## Project Completion Summary (Current State)

### What’s Completed
- Assistant conversation end-to-end (flag-gated):
  - Mobile assistant entry and ChatScreen integration behind `ASSISTANT_ENABLED`.
  - Lambda endpoint (API Gateway → `assistant-mvp`) receives chat requests and posts replies via AppSync.
- Conversation history retrieval (RAG):
  - Lambda reads last ~10 messages for context (AppSync query), with retries and timeouts.
- Preferences & lists memory:
  - “Set/Show preferences” via SYSTEM metadata + `pref:{...}` sentinel; merged forward.
  - “Save/Add/Show/List lists” via SYSTEM metadata + `list:{...}` sentinel.
- OpenAI replies with strict JSON and fallback:
  - `ASSISTANT_OPENAI_ENABLED` gate; 6s timeout; validate `{ text, events?[] }`; fallback to weekend template with `events[]`.
- Calendar events and CTA (mobile):
  - Parse `metadata.events` or `events:{...}`; render CTA; persist target calendar; write events via `expo-calendar`.
- Recipes (dinner intent):
  - `ASSISTANT_RECIPE_ENABLED` gate; Themealdb retriever with ~3.5s budget; post `metadata.recipes` and `recipes:{...}`; mobile modal shows items.
- Deploy & env hygiene:
  - `scripts/agent/deploy.ps1` sets Lambda env flags and optional `OPENAI_SECRET_ARN`.
  - Example envs updated for mobile and Lambda; new mobile flags scaffolded.
- Reliability & UX:
  - Subscriptions deliver assistant replies; read receipts, notifications, presence, and chat UI improvements per MVP docs.

### What’s Remaining (Flag-Gated Plan)
- Event conflict warnings (`ASSISTANT_CONFLICTS_ENABLED`)
- Decision summarization (`ASSISTANT_DECISIONS_ENABLED`)
- Priority highlighting (`ASSISTANT_PRIORITY_ENABLED`)
- RSVP tracking (`ASSISTANT_RSVP_ENABLED`)
- Deadline extraction (`ASSISTANT_DEADLINES_ENABLED`)
- Group assistant chat with add participants (`ASSISTANT_GROUP_ENABLED`)
- Explicit OpenAI tool-calling or framework adoption (Vercel AI SDK/Swarm/LangChain), behind a flag

### Rationale for Not Using a Heavy Framework (Yet)
- We prioritized non-breaking, low-latency delivery with strict fallbacks and small blast radius.
- The current Lambda “mini-agent” provides the required capabilities with clear contracts and can be incrementally upgraded to a recommended framework without changing client code.

### Risks & Mitigations
- External API latency/availability → strict timeouts + template fallback.
- Eventual consistency for metadata → retries and attachment sentinel fallback.
- Secrets management → Secrets Manager (`OPENAI_SECRET_ARN`) and least-privilege IAM.

### Suggested Next Steps
1) Implement decision/priorities/RSVPs/deadlines/conflicts as metadata with sentinels and UI CTAs, all behind flags.
2) Add explicit OpenAI tool-calling or integrate a framework (flag-gated); keep JSON validation and fallbacks.
3) Enable group assistant chat add-participants UI and guard changes with flags.
